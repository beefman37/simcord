# Introduction

To get started with Simcord we need to understand how it works. Simcord is like a bridge between your discord chats and your phone's inbox. This documentation presents Simcord in such a way you're in total control of your resources. We'll start from a free tier and if you want you more you could pay using accounts that we help you set up along the way. You'll also be control of hosting and deployment.

## Steps
Instructions to get up and running.
<br />
The instructions are divided into **three** categories that we need to cover one by one:

1. Generate a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) **token** that will be used to interact with Discord on your behalf.

2. Go live and **deploy** Simcord to the cloud.

3. Configure the **SMS gateway** so we could send SMS texts and receive them.
